Today we invite you to write an exciting game â€” Moon Lander. As always, we'll start with the rules.
The objective is guide a landing module down to the lunar surface. To do this, the player must overcome the Moon's gravitational attraction,
using an aft booster to slow the descent and side thrusters to move the ship left or right.
The terrain is bumpy and there's only one flat area suitable for a soft landing. We'll call it the "platform". If the player lands successfully, he or she wins.
The score depends on how long the landing lasts: The longer a player takes to land, the lower the final score.
The game ends when the player smashes into the surface of the Moon.
Well, let's start with the game's main class: MoonLanderGame.
We'll make it inherit the Game class.

This and other "game engine" classes are contained in the com.codegym.engine.cell package. To use them, the MoonLanderGame class must include the following import:
Now we'll implement the playing field. To do this, we need to override the initialize() method, which in turn must call the setScreenSize(int, int) method.
This method sets the playing field's width and height, which it takes as arguments. We'll store them in variables.

To complete the Moon Lander task successfully, we recommend that you read this article about the "Games" section. It contains information that you'll find helpful when writing games.


Requirements:
1.	There must be a public MoonLanderGame class.
2.	The MoonLanderGame class must inherit the Game class.
3.	The MoonLanderGame class must have a public static final int WIDTH field, initialized to 64 when it is declared.
4.	The MoonLanderGame class must have a public static final int HEIGHT field, initialized to 64 when it is declared.
5.	In the MoonLanderGame class, the initialize() method of the Game parent class must be overridden.
6.	The Game class&#39;s setScreenSize(int, int) method must be called with arguments (WIDTH, HEIGHT) in the initialize() method.
7.	The MoonLanderGame class must have a statement that imports the entire contents of the com.codegym.engine.cell package.
