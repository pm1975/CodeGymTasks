We invite you to write an exciting game â€” Racer. We'll start with the rules.
1. The objective of the game is to reach the finish line by driving a race car on a busy race track.
2. The score depends on how long the race lasts: the sooner a player finishes, the higher his or her score.
3. The game is over when the player hits another car or an obstacle.

Let's create the game's main class: RacerGame. To make use of the game engine, we'll make our class inherit the Game
class, which has methods for implementing the game. To start, we need a playing field (64x64) to which we'll add game objects.
Because the field's width and height will be used often in the game logic, it makes sense to create WIDTH and HEIGHT constants.
Before the game starts, the initialize() method runs. Its purpose is to set up the game's initial state. You need to override it in the RacerGame class.

In the initialize() method, you need to:
1. set the dimensions of the playing field by calling setScreenSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
2. disable display of the grid by calling showGrid(false).
To complete the Racer task successfully, we recommend that you read this article about the "Games" section. It contains information that you'll find helpful when writing games.

Requirements:
1.	There must be a public RacerGame class.
2.	The RacerGame class must inherit the Game class.
3.	The RacerGame class must have a public static final int WIDTH field, initialized to 64 when it is declared.
4.	The RacerGame class must have a public static final int HEIGHT field, initialized to 64 when it is declared.
5.	In the RacerGame class, the initialize() method of the Game parent class must be overridden.
6.	In the initialize() method, the Game class&#39;s showGrid(boolean) method must be called with false as the argument.
7.	The Game class&#39;s setScreenSize(int, int) method must be called with arguments (WIDTH, HEIGHT) in the initialize() method.
8.	The RacerGame class must have a statement that imports the entire contents of the com.codegym.engine.cell package.
