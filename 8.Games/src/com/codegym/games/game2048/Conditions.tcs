We'll use the game engine to display the current state of the game. And a 4x4 array is perfect for storing
the state.

So, create an int[][] gameField field and initialize with a SIDExSIDE int[][] array.
By default, the elements of the int array are initialized with zeros. Let zeros represent an empty square on
the game board.


Requirements:
1.	A private int[][] (matrix or two-dimensional int array) gameField field must be created in the Game2048 class.
2.	The matrix size must be SIDExSIDE.
3.	A void createGame() method must be created in the Game2048 class.
4.	The createGame() method must be called in the initialize() method.


2048 (Part 2/18)

Have you tried running your program? The game board is too small. Let's fix that. To do this, we need to
override the initialize() method of the Game parent class. The initialize() method lets you
set the size of the game board, decide whether to display the grid, etc.

To set the size of the game board in the initialize() method, call the
setScreenSize(int width, int height) method of the Game parent class, passing it the width and height
of the game board. As you know, the size of the game board in our game is 4x4 tiles. We suggest that you
create a private
static final int SIDE variable (constant) whose value is 4 and pass it as the arguments to the
setScreenSize() method. You should end up with something like this: setScreenSize(SIDE, SIDE). You can run
your own program again
and see what happens.



2048 (Part 1/18)

Hi! Today we'll start writing an interesting and addictive game â€” 2048. Are you ready? Then let's go.
Rules of the game:
The game board is square. The standard board size is 4x4 tiles. The objective of the game is to get a tile
whose value is 2048.
1. A tile with a value of 2 (probability of 90%) or 4 (probability of 10%) appears in each round.
2. You can shift all the tiles on the game board to one of the 4 sides by pressing the corresponding key:
up, down,
right, or left. If a shift causes two tiles with the same value to "collide", then they merge into one.
The new value is the sum of the merged tiles. After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in
an empty
space on the game board. If pressing a key does not cause the tiles to change locations or values, then no
turn has been made.
3. If more than two tiles of the same value are in the same row or column, then they merge from the side
from which they are being shifted. For example, after a shift to the left, the tiles (4, 4, 4, 0) in the
same row
become (8, 4, 0, 0). After a shift to the right, they become (0, 0, 4, 8). This way of handling ambiguity
makes it possible to more accurately formulate a game strategy.
4. With each merger, the score increases by the value of the resulting tile.
5. The game is lost if no further moves are possible.
6. The game ends in victory if a tile with the value 2048 appears on the game board.

Now let's start implementing the game:
First, we'll need a class where the game logic will be implemented. Let's call it Game2048.
We've created a "game engine" that starts the game itself, redraws game elements, etc.
Accordingly, your Game2048 class must inherit the Game class. This and other engine classes are located
in the com.codegym.engine.cell package. To use them, the Game2048 class must include the following import
statement:
import com.codegym.engine.cell.*;
Try running your Game2048 class and see what happens.
