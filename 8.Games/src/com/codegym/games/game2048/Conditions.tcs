Hi! Today we'll start writing an interesting and addictive game â€” 2048. Are you ready? Then let's go.
Rules of the game:
The game board is square. The standard board size is 4x4 tiles. The objective of the game is to get a tile
whose value is 2048.
1. A tile with a value of 2 (probability of 90%) or 4 (probability of 10%) appears in each round.
2. You can shift all the tiles on the game board to one of the 4 sides by pressing the corresponding key:
up, down,
right, or left. If a shift causes two tiles with the same value to "collide", then they merge into one.
The new value is the sum of the merged tiles. After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears in
an empty
space on the game board. If pressing a key does not cause the tiles to change locations or values, then no
turn has been made.
3. If more than two tiles of the same value are in the same row or column, then they merge from the side
from which they are being shifted. For example, after a shift to the left, the tiles (4, 4, 4, 0) in the
same row
become (8, 4, 0, 0). After a shift to the right, they become (0, 0, 4, 8). This way of handling ambiguity
makes it possible to more accurately formulate a game strategy.
4. With each merger, the score increases by the value of the resulting tile.
5. The game is lost if no further moves are possible.
6. The game ends in victory if a tile with the value 2048 appears on the game board.

Now let's start implementing the game:
First, we'll need a class where the game logic will be implemented. Let's call it Game2048.
We've created a "game engine" that starts the game itself, redraws game elements, etc.
Accordingly, your Game2048 class must inherit the Game class. This and other engine classes are located
in the com.codegym.engine.cell package. To use them, the Game2048 class must include the following import
statement:
import com.codegym.engine.cell.*;
Try running your Game2048 class and see what happens.


Requirements:
1.	A Game2048 class must be created.
2.	The Game2048 class must be public.
3.	The Game2048 class must inherit the Game class.
4.	The Game2048 class must have a statement that imports the entire contents of the com.codegym.engine.cell.
